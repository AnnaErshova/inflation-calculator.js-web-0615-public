# jQuery Inflation Calculator

![inflated dollar](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/web-dev-readme-photos/js/inflation.jpg)

## Background

In economics, [inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) can be defined as a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.

## Objective

You'll be using JavaScript to make an inflation calculator. It will use jQuery to fetch the user's input in the three input fields (start date, end date, start price), and using those values, query an API using jQuery's `getJSON` method. You will then add this value to the input with an id of `endPrice`.

Right click on the link below and select "Save link as..." to see a video of how your calculator should behave.

## jQuery's `getJSON` funtion

jQuery's [getJSON](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/) funtion is just a shorthand for it's [ajax](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) function.



# Testing

```
> ironboard  # runs only in the terminal
> ironboard -b # runs also in the browser
